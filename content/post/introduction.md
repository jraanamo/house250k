## The Difference

I could imagine that building a house is very different from country to country. The rules and legislations are different. The cost of material and labour are different. The climates are different. The nature and landscape and even the underlying soil is different. And people who live in them are _very_ different.

The web is full of blogs about _How I built my house_. But they are mostly targeted to people living in the same country. For example, there are plenty of very informative  blogs about houses being build in Finland - but they are all usually in Finnish. This blog aims to provide a quite detailed and technical perspective about how it is to build a private house in Finland. For people to read from different countries and maybe to compare with their own projects.

## The House

The house about to be built has 150m2 (or 1614 square feet) and should comfortably fit two adults and two children. It will be mostly made out of wood and needs to be well isolated to be cost efficient. It should be contemporary, timeless, and it should melt into it's surroundings. So basically a typical Scandinavian building.

We are not going to built the house ourselves from scratch though. I've done it once and takes too much time. To save some of that time, and hopefully money, we are getting the base frame made ready and assembled for us. That does not mean that there would not still be plenty of work left. I am assuming that at least one years worth of it.

## The Status

Today we have the land and just recently we got the permit to start building. To get this far, we had imagined doing this for more than ten years, started looking at different styles of buildings few years ago and started talking with the house manufacturing companies seriously one or two years ago. Then, what feels like endless number of hours was spent at finding the right professionals - as required by the building legislation - and waiting for days and weeks for these professionals to respond to simple questions, in vain. Then finding new professionals who actually might do what they promised and take your project further.

After all that fighting and waiting we are now only at the _very beginning_ of the project. But I cannot wait to get started!
